This project is made using the leading edge technology of <b>Next.js</b> , <b>Tailwind.css</b> ,<b>Solidity</b> , <b>Hardhat</b> , <b>RainbowKit</b>,
<b>Wagmi</b> and <b>IPFS</b>(<b>Web3.storage</b>) . The contract is deployed on goerli testnet using <b>Alchemy</b>.

The landing page of the website is pretty simple on purpose , we know the peoples will be stressed . At first we just have to enter the basic detaiils just to 
make a account of the person , then just after registration you will be redirected to your <b>DOCS (documents)</b> page. Yes its that simple.

The next time you are visiting the page you dont have to do anything (you will be automatically redirected to the Docs page).

On docs page there you will see the side modal which you can close if you want . There you will see your info and the options of uploading your 
precious data , You can also delete your data if you want . You will have the full power to control your data and guss what it is secured with blockchain 
technology means no one (including government and the site owner itself) cant delete your data . (Thats cool üòé right?) You can also update your details if you 
have made any typoüòÖ

## How To Get Started ?? üçÄ

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
